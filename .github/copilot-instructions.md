# Copilot instructions — Bogdan-lessons

Purpose: small playground project used for learning / experiments. Keep changes minimal and explicit.

- **Big picture**: a tiny static site with one `index.html` and a simple `js/main.js` used as a sandbox.

- **Conventions**:
  - Scripts are plain ES scripts (no bundler). Keep code small and self-contained in `js/main.js`.
  - Styles and assets are minimal / absent — add files under `css/` or `img/` only when referenced from HTML.

- **Safe operations**:
  - Add/remove console examples in `js/main.js` for learning purposes.
  - Keep commits focused and small; note in commit message that changes are educational.

- **Where to look**:
  - `index.html` — shell of page.
  - `js/main.js` — current logic and examples.

If you want more structure (tests or a dev server), ask and I will propose a minimal setup.
